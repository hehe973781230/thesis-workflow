# MBA / Academic Thesis Multi-Agent Workflow

A complete workflow for writing MBA and academic theses using multi-agent collaboration, supporting dual-version drafting, review, integration, and finalization.

Suitable for the full lifecycle from thesis proposal to final graduation thesis.

## Core Features

- **Dual-Version Drafting**: Version H (Hermes deep reasoning) + Version O (OpenClaw format compliance)
- **Phase 3 Review**: 7-dimension strict review (format / outline / content accuracy / plagiarism check / academic standards / literature completeness / writing grammar)
- **Phase 3.5 Academic Deep Review**: 3-round deep review (macro structure → chapter-by-chapter → cross-chapter consistency)
- **Phase 4 Integration**: Review Agent produces integration plan, Orchestrator executes
- **Phase 5 Word Output**: md2docx_strict.py compliant script + optional AI humanization (Phase 5.1) → Word generation (Phase 5.2)

### v1.7 New: Loop Agent Architecture

- **Orchestrator Loop**: Auto-decides next action after each Phase completion
- **Self-Check Guardrails**: 10 automated checks (chapter completeness, citations, word count, table format)
- **Review Loop**: Auto-revisits revisions, passes after 2 consecutive rounds with no new P0 issues
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: 4 mandatory checkpoints for key decisions

### New Files (v1.7)

- `scripts/loop_self_check.py`: Automated Guardrails validation script (10 checks + JSON output)
- `references/checklist.md`: Academic standards checklist
- `references/loop-design.md`: Loop design principles documentation

## Supported Use Cases
